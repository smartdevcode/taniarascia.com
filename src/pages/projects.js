            I built this app because I wanted a simpler, IDE-like, WYSIWYG-free
            note-taking program that would be accessible from any platform via
            the web. I also wanted it to sync without creating users or
            requiring a database.
          </p>
          <p>
            The app allows plain text or markdown with previews, syncing,
            internal wiki style note-linking, drag-and-drop, prettier, syntax
            highlighting, light/dark mode, search, categorizing, and more!

            Chip8.js includes a CPU class that handles all the internal logic of
            the emulator, and individual classes written for interfacing with a
            web, command line, or native client. The emulator plays CHIP-8 ROMs
            for simple games like Pong, Tron, and Tetris.

            While writing this project, I learned a lot of fundamentals about
            binary and hexadecimal base systems, how bits and bytes work along
            with ASCII encoding and big/little endian values. I also learned
            about CPU memory, timers, stacks, the fetch/decode/execute cycle,
            and creating clean interfaces for the logic of your code to
            communicate with.

            In my time of working with custom PHP systems, I noticed a lot of
            extremely messy, haphazardly put-together code, code that had no
            sense of design or planning, and was also outdated and insecure.
          </p>
          <p>
            I wanted to teach myself how to make a clean system using MVC design
            patterns and clear separation of concerns between the PHP
            object-oriented logic, HTML routes, JavaScript interactions, and CSS
            styles, that also utilized the latest methods for secure database
            connections.

            A front-end design toolkit for developing responsive web apps.

            I made my first websites in the late '90s, when HTML was written in
            uppercase, tables were using for creating layouts, and CSS didn't
            exist yet. When CSS came around I learned the most basic of float
            based layouts, but then I went off and worked another career for a
            decade.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I came back, something called responsive design was all the
            rage, and Bootstrap, Semantic UI, and Foundation were popular ways
            to implement it. I wasn't happy using something I didn't understand,
            and I thought those frameworks were too bloated, so I created my own
            with Sass that I used for several design projects. Primitive was
            created to provide helpful, browser-consistent styling for default
            HTML elements, such as buttons, forms, tables, lists, and
            typography.
